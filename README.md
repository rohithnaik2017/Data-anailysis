Credit card transaction fraud detection analysis using Machine learning models

The main objective of the Credit card transaction fraud analysis is to predict that if the customer credit card transaction is fraud or not-fraud

The steps involved in the project are:

1.Explorinng the dataset also visualizing it.
2.Data preprocessing.
3.Scaling and distribution.
4.Creating subsample will be a dataframe with a 50/50 ratio of fraud and non-fraud transactions.
5.Building machine learning models.
6.Evaluting the models.
7.Tuning the parameters for better accuracy.
8.Random undersampling involves randomly selecting examples from the majority class and deleting them from the training dataset.
9.Finding accuracy using logistics regression,K-nearest neighbour and support vector machine.
